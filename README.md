### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to figure out which flex options should I use in each device view. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Tricks Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
- This helped my to build the splitting header section.
